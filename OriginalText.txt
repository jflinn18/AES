Before I met you,
I felt that I couldn't love anyone,
That nobody would be able to fill the void in my heart,
But that all changed when I met you...
Then I came to realize you were always on my mind.
You're funny and sweet,
You make me laugh and smile,
You take away all my anger and sadness,
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen,
More beautiful than any flower that I have ever seen,
You made me weak when I talked to you,
Then I started to write poems about you,
Now, I have come to realize that I am in love with you.
